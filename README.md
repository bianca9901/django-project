## Design

### The design choice:
I aimed to give the restaurant website a modern and sleek style, which drove my font and background color choices. I wanted a classic look and chose grey, off-white, white, and gold.

With the modern feel as the base, I also wanted to give the restaurant a warm, and joyful ambiance. Therefore, the images were carefully selected to create an atmosphere that aligns with the restaurant's philosophy and key features.

When it comes to the messages and buttons, I wanted them to catch the eye. That's why I opted for attention-grabbing colors. These colors may not align with the sleek and classic palette, but they resonate with the modern style.

Typography played a vital role too. I aimed for a cool and hip style that resonates with the targeted audience.

As for the logo and the signed "-Django Team" text pieces, I aspired to select a Google font that portrays a handwritten feel, adding a personal touch.

### Colors used:
